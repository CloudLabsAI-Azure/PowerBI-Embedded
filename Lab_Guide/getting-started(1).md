# Power BI Embedded Hands On Lab

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview

This lab provides hands-on experience with Power BI Embedded, guiding participants through the process of integrating interactive Power BI reports and dashboards into custom applications. Through step-by-step exercises, you will learn how to embed and configure Power BI content using the App Owns Data model. The lab also covers key features such as natural language queries (Q&A), data export, and row-level security (RLS) to deliver personalized and secure analytics experiences. By the end of this lab, you will be equipped with the skills to build scalable and interactive reporting solutions that enhance data-driven decision-making within your applications.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Embed Power BI reports:** Integrate reports into a web application using the App Owns Data model with service principal authentication.

- **Enable natural language queries:** Embed the Q&A visual to allow users to interact with data using natural language.

- **Export report data:** Configure export options to allow users to download visual data as CSV files.

- **Apply row-level security (RLS):** Implement RLS to restrict data access based on user roles for secure, personalized reporting.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of Power BI and the Power BI Service
- Familiarity with Power BI workspace concepts and report publishing
- Working knowledge of Visual Studio Code and editing JSON/C# files
- Experience using Power Query and data transformation techniques
- Foundational knowledge of authentication concepts

## Architechture

The architecture for integrating **Power BI Embedded** into applications involves using the **Power BI Embedded** service, which allows embedding **Power BI** reports and dashboards within your application. The reports are created and stored in the **Power BI service**, and authentication is managed via **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** to ensure secure access. A client application communicates with **Power BI** using the **Power BI REST API** to embed reports and handle user interactions. The application displays these reports seamlessly, enabling users to explore and interact with the embedded data. This architecture leverages **Azure's cloud capabilities** to deliver scalable, interactive data visualizations within custom applications.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components:

- **Power BI Embedded Service**: Allows the integration of Power BI reports and dashboards into custom applications, enabling users to view interactive reports directly within the app.
- **Power BI Reports and Dashboards**: The visualizations and data insights created in Power BI that can be embedded into external applications.
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Provides identity and access management, ensuring secure authentication and authorization for Power BI Embedded users.
- **Power BI REST API**: A set of web services that allows developers to interact with Power BI resources, enabling the embedding of reports, management of user access, and more.
- **Power BI Workspace**: A container within Power BI for organizing and managing reports and datasets, which can be shared or embedded into other applications.
